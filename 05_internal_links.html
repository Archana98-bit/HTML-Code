    <p style="font-size: 20px;color: green;">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR; (15 October 1931-27 July 2015) 
    was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007.
    He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
    He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research
    and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
    was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
    He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile
    and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
    and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
    nuclear test by India in 1974.

    <h1 id="Albert">Albert Einstein</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;color: brown;">Albert Einstein (14 March 1879-18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist
    who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time.
    Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also made important contributions to
    quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific
    understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century.
    His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory,
    has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics
    "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
    effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.
    His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading
    physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest
    physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word Einstein 
    broadly synonymous with genius.

    <p style="font-size: 20px;color: navy;">Charles Robert Darwin FRS FRGS FLS FZS JP (DAR-win; 12 February 1809-19 April 1882)
    was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist,[8] widely known for his contributions to evolutionary
    biology. His proposition that all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally
    accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace,
    he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called
    natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved
    in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history and
    was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.
