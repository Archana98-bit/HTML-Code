        <p><span style="color: chartreuse;">Science</span> is a rigorous, systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of 
           testable explanations and predictions about the world. Modern science is typically divided into 
           three major branches: natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology), which study the 
           physical world; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study 
           individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer 
           science), which study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules. There is disagreement whether the 
           formal sciences are science disciplines, because they do not rely on empirical evidence.</p>

           <p>The history of scientific discipline spans the majority of the historical record, with the earliest
            written records of identifiable predecessors to modern science dating to Bronze Age Egypt and 
            Mesopotamia from around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine 
            entered and shaped the Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were 
            made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes, while further 
            advancements, including the introduction of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, were made during the 
            Golden Age of India.</p>

        <p><span style="color: yellow;">Computer</span> science is the study of computation, information, and automation.
           Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and 
           information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and
           software). Though more often considered an academic discipline, computer science is closely related to
           computer programming.</p>

           <p> Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as
            problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and
            animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video
            data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.
            The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.
            The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: lime;">H</span>istory</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><span style="color: brown;">History</span> (derived from Ancient Greek ἱστορία (historía) 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation')
           is the systematic study and documentation of the human past.
           The period of events before the invention of writing systems is considered prehistory.
           "History" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection,
           organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events. Historians seek knowledge of the past
           using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material artifacts, and
           ecological markers.</p>

        <p>History is an academic discipline which uses a narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past
           events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect. Historians debate which narrative best
           explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians debate the
           nature of history as an end in itself, and its usefulness in giving perspective on the problems of the
           present.</p>
