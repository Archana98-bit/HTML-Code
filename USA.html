    <p>The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S.) or informally America,
        is a country primarily located in North America and consisting of 50 states, a federal district,
        five major unincorporated territories, and nine Minor Outlying Islands. It includes 326 Indian
        reservations. The U.S. is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.
        It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders
        with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations. With a population of over 333 million, it is the most
        populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of
        the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is
        New York City.

        Indigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607,
        British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern
        United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation,
        which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared
        independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of
        unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and republicanism. The country began expanding across
        North America, spanning the continent by 1848.
