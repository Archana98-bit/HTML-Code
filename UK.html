    <p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK)
        or Britain, is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the north-western coast of the continental mainland.
        It comprises England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It includes the island of Great Britain,
        the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and most of the smaller islands within the British Isles.
        Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland; otherwise, the United Kingdom is
        surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea.
        The total area of the United Kingdom is 93,628 square miles (242,495 km2), with an estimated 2022 population
        of nearly 67 million people.

        The United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and separations of constituent countries
        over several hundred years. The Treaty of Union between the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and
        the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707 resulted in their unification to become the Kingdom of Great Britain.
        Its union in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
        Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and
        Northern Ireland, which formally adopted its name in 1927. The nearby Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey
        are not part of the UK, being Crown Dependencies, but the British government is responsible for their
        defence and international representation.
